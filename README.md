### Small angle scattering model for LMO

The purpose of this github repository is to make available the Boltzmann model code for the publication "Emergent symmetry in a low dimensional superconductor
on the edge of Mottness" by P. Chudzinski, M. Berben _et al._ in the spirit of open science. This repository consists of the following parts:

- Relaxation time model H//c no c-axis warping
- Relaxation time model H//c with c-axis warping
- Small angle scatteing model H//c no c-axis warping
- Documentation on the mathematics and use of the model

For any inquiries, please see the README file for contact details.
Please make yourself familiar with the LICENSE file.

### Adopting this code

The code here presented can be readily adopted to calculate the MR in any quasi-1D system.
Please read the documentation, but be assured that changing tight binding coefficients
is trivial and changing the dispersion away from a simple tight binding requires minimal changes.

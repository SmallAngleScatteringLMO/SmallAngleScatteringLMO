### Small angle scattering model for LMO

The purpose of this github repository is to make available the Boltzmann model code for the publication "Emergent symmetry in a low dimensional superconductor on the edge of Mottness" by P. Chudzinski, M. Berben _et al._ in the spirit of open science. This repository consists of the following parts:

- Relaxation time model H//c no c-axis warping
- Relaxation time model H//c with c-axis warping
- Small angle scattering model H//c no c-axis warping
- Overview on the mathematics, use of the model and extra details on the results

For any inquiries, please see the LICENSE file for contact details.
Please make yourself familiar with the LICENSE file.

Please note that we do our best to make this code available free of errors,
if you have any concerns, feel free to contact us or submit a pull request.

### Adopting this code

The code here presented can be readily adopted to calculate the MR in any quasi-1D system.
Please read the documentation, but be assured that changing tight binding coefficients
is trivial and changing the dispersion away from a simple tight binding requires minimal changes.
The same holds for the type of backscattering interaction, there are 5 implemented to
give you inspiration.
Please note that in line with the LICENSE file, no guarantees are given.

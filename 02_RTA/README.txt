This folder contains the code used to calculate the RTA MR 
for the LMO Fermi surfaces within an isotropic-tau approximation.

Please execute 'tests.py' file and make sure all is OK.
Then execute 'execute.py' and enter which Fermi surface to compute on.

The generated output files (over)write the output folder.
There are pre-computed data files there.
These are used to plot the RTA results in the paper.
